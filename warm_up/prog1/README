Incomplete warmup assignment. 

test.cpp incuded, and modified as follows:
=========================================

-testing of MyClass, int, Stress commented out. 

-code to test PersonPtr pasted into test.cpp at where
 it would be called as a macro (List_DEFINE(PersonPtr))

-dummy List_DEFINE(PersonPtr) made so as not to disturb other code.

-function 'check' commented out inability to compile.

Goals achieved:
==============

- All of part 1 works; and the PersonPtr part of part 2.

-I believe my List.hpp macro was close to working, but didn't.

-person 'classes' implemented (freeing memory wouldn't work for me)

-doubly linked circular list with sentinel implemented

-iterators work 

-merge-sort works on list in-place, without moving any data
